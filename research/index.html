                <p class="mb-1"> This paper studies dynamic linear fixed effect models that allow for unobserved heterogeneity in individual responses and dynamics in a short panel setting. The model allows both the coefficients and the intercept to be individual-specific. I show that the model is not point-identified and yet partially identified, and I characterize the sharp identified sets of mean, variance and the distribution itself of the partial effect distribution. The characterization applies to both discrete and continuous data. A computationally feasible estimation and inference procedure is proposed, which is based on a fast and exact global polynomial optimization algorithm. The method is applied to study life-cycle earnings and consumption dynamics of U.S. households in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) dataset. The estimation results suggest that there is large heterogeneity in earnings persistence and earnings elasticity of consumption and that there is a strong correlation between the two. Calibration of a life-cycle model suggests that heterogeneity in the asset-related factors such as heterogeneity in interest rates or discount rates is required to accurately describe real-world consumption and savings behavior.

                <p class="mb-1"> This paper proposes a novel estimation algorithm for interactive fixed effect models, namely linear fixed effect models in which individual and time fixed effects appear multiplicatively. A serious computational challenge faced by interactive fixed effect models is that the least squares estimator requires a researcher to globally minimize a non-convex objective function. This challenge requires the researcher to minimize the least squares criterion with multiple starting values, and yet the researcher is not convinced of its global optimality. This paper proposes an estimation algorithm that globally minimize the least squares criterion. The algorithm does not depend on the starting value and, more importantly, provides certificate of global optimality for the least squares estimator.

                <p class="mb-1"> This paper studies panel data binary choice models that allow for unobserved heterogeneity in state dependence and partial effect of regressors. Existing literature on panel data binary choice models allow the levels of the linear index to be heterogeneous. This paper studies binary choice models that also allow for heterogeneity in the coefficients on lagged outcomes and regressors, hence allowing for heterogeneity in state dependence and partial effects. I characterize the sharp identified sets of causal parameters such as average marginal effects, where the characterization allows the regressors to be discrete or continuous. An estimation method for the identified sets are proposed.

                <p class="mb-1"> We consider estimation of the drift function of a stationary diffusion process when we observe high-frequency data with microstructure noise over a long time interval. We propose to estimate the drift function at a point by a Nadaraya–Watson estimator that uses observations that have been pre-averaged to reduce the noise. We give conditions under which our estimator is consistent and asympotically normal. Its rate and asymptotic bias and variance are the same as those without microstructure noise. To use our method in data analysis, we propose a data-based cross-validation method to determine the bandwidth in the Nadaraya–Watson estimator. Via simulation, we study several methods of bandwidth choices, and compare our estimator to several existing estimators. In terms of mean squared error, our new estimator outperforms existing estimators.
